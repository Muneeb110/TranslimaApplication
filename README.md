# Translima Application
This is a WinForms application developed for a client. The application is designed to perform certain tasks related to XML file processing. It provides a user interface where the user can configure settings and start or stop the processing of XML files.

## Getting Started
To run the application, follow these steps:

Ensure that you have the necessary dependencies installed on your system.
Build the project and generate the executable file.
Double-click the executable file to launch the application.
## Features
### Selecting INI File
Clicking the "INI File" button opens a file dialog where the user can browse and select an INI file.
The selected file path is displayed in the "Txt_INIFile" text box.
The application reads the contents of the INI file and populates various settings fields based on the configuration.
### Start/Stop Processing
Clicking the "Start" button initiates the processing of XML files.
The application reads XML files from the specified polling folder.
It performs various operations on the files and updates the database accordingly.
The processing is done asynchronously using background tasks.
While the processing is in progress, the "Start" button is disabled, and a progress spinner is displayed.
Clicking the "Stop" button terminates the ongoing processing.
### Displaying Data
The application displays the processed data in different grid views, such as history, commercial, customs offices, invoices, items, and parties.
The grid views are updated dynamically as the processing progresses.
### Logging
The application utilizes a logging framework to log information and errors.
The log file path, log level, and log file name are read from the INI file and used for logging purposes.
### Configuration
The application relies on an INI file for configuration. The following settings are used:

**INIFile:** Specifies the path of the INI file to be used.  
**PollingFolder:** Specifies the folder path where XML files are read from.  
**ProcessedFolder:** Specifies the folder path where processed XML files are moved.  
**Timer:** Specifies the interval (in seconds) at which the application checks for new XML files.  
**ConnectionString:** Specifies the connection string for the database.  
**LogPath:** Specifies the folder path where log files are stored.  
**LogLevel:** Specifies the log level (either "Info" or "Debug").  
**FileName:** Specifies the name of the log file.  
**PDFFolder:** Specifies the folder path for PDF files.  
**PDFSizeLimit:** Specifies the size limit for PDF files.  
## Dependencies
The application has dependencies on the following libraries:

**MetroFramework:** Provides UI components and styling for the application.
**IniParser:** Allows parsing of INI files to extract configuration settings.
Make sure these dependencies are present and properly referenced in the project.

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues or errors while using the application, consider the following steps:

Verify that the necessary dependencies are installed and up to date.
Check if the INI file specified in the application settings is valid and accessible.
Ensure that the required folders (polling folder, processed folder, log folder, etc.) exist and have appropriate permissions.
Review the log files generated by the application to identify any error messages or exceptions.
If the issue persists, please contact the developer for assistance.
